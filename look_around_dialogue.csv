1;Hoorayyy you found a secret room!!!
2;This place looks like a dungeon. You see a few cells around you, and in one of them, a prisoner is sitting.
3;You walk into a huge hall. The only thing that interests you is the door that seems to lead outside, but it's locked.
4;A living room. You notice a huge bed that could fit 10 people, while you barely fit on your bed at home.
5;This looks like some sort of theatre stage. You can see a lot of props, and the only useful one is a bucket, but it's too high up.
6;A kitchen. You see a lot of food, like bananas, apples, sausages, bread, and ingredients for cooking, such as salt, pepper, and garlic. You also notice a man cooking something.
7;This is most certainly a throne room. Everything looks so expensive, and you can see lots of valuable items everywhere. However, you should focus on escaping right now rather than getting rich.
8;After walking countless steps up, you arrive at the tower. There is a lot of stuff, like skis, a hammer, a mop, and a chest that seems to be stuck.
9;After walking countless steps up, you arrive at the tower. Nothing seems interesting, though you notice a ladder, but it's only half of it.
10;You're in a huge garden. You see many flowers around you and notice someone trimming the bushes.
11;A well, which is obviously used to get water.
12;A big gate stands in front of you. You can see a keyhole in it, perhaps this is the only way out?
